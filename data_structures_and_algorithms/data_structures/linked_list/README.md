# Singly Linked List
it is the famous data structure in the world!

& there is alot of solutions and algorithms to create linked list .. checkout them here..

<br>

## Challenge
this challenge are trying to let you get many solutions for 'linked list' .. then get the least complicated one..
somehow 'getting the Big O Notation'..!

it was fun and cool to try it :)

<br>

## Approach & Efficiency
well for me .. i learned alot that is alot ways to slove proplem but always the best solution is which dosent need alot of time and memory to excute and get you the answer..
no mater how data you had..or even in worst case it is!!

its always the better performance way to work with..this is what called: (Big O)

<br>

## API
use:
- name = LinkedList() // to create a new linked list
- name.insert(vlaue) // it will insert the head then continue the linked list...
- name.include(vlaue) // it will search inside the linked list for your value & retruns boolen..
- name.tostring() // it will retruns the linked list nodes by specifec format '{ a } -> { b } -> NULL'
- name.append(value) // it will append your new node to the linked list
- name.insertBefore(value, newVal) // it will insert the new value before the first one..
- name.insertAfter(value, newVal) // it will insert the new value after the first one..
- name.kthFromEnd(k) // it returns the nodeâ€™s value that is 'k' from the end of the linked list..
